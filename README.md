Sudoku on Shoes
===============

Sudoku is a famous puzzle. Look at [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku).

[Steve Pugh](http://rubylearning.com/blog/2009/04/17/interview-author-steve-pugh/), auther of **Wicked Cool Ruby Scripts**, gave me a good suggestion in the first ever Book Promotion Class of RubyLearning. So, I wrote this tiny Shoes app. :)

Sudoku on Shoes uses a fantastic [Sudoku Solver](http://github.com/jimweirich/sudoku/tree/master) created by **Jim Weirich** and great **Sudoku Generator** created by **Michael Uplawski**. Thanks!
